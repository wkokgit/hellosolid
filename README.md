# Hello World Solid Application

This repository is created to help starting developers get the grips of developing a Solid application. It is forked from [here](https://melvincarvalho.github.io/helloworld/) where Melvin Carvalho created a version which I extended upon.

Here is a [Demo](https://wkokgit.github.io/helloworld/) of my Hello World application.

It is adviced to run the application using the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package.

Run ```http-server``` in terminal and go to the ip address in your browser to open the application.
