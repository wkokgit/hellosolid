# Hello Solid

This repository is created as part of my master project about Solid to help starting developers get the grips of developing a Solid client application. It is forked from [here](https://melvincarvalho.github.io/helloworld/), which is a repository created by Melvin Carvalho that I extended upon.

Here is a [Demo](https://wkokgit.github.io/hellosolid/) of my Hello Solid application.

When running locally, it is adviced to run the application using the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package. I did this to test this project. 

Run ```http-server``` in terminal at the project location and go to the ip address in your browser to open the application.
